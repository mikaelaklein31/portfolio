I am a senior at Castro Valley High School and I have been keeping myself busy this summer by attending a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in San Francisco. This program is the reason why I made this cool website! Some things I like to do are volunteering in my Key Club, getting boba with my friends, and petting dogs that are not actually mine. Some things I don't like include having to return aforementioned dogs to their owners after they follow me out of the park I was at, being sleep deprived, and yellowjackets,who are evil. A fun fact about me is that I have been doing cross country and track since I was in sixth grade! Another fun fact is that this is probably because I cannot actually play any other sport because I am very uncoordinated! I also spend a lot of time on the web, you can see some of my favorite websites below!';action()"/>
