<h1 style="font-family:century gothic;">MY GIRLS WHO CODE REFLECTIONS</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Intro to Robotics </h2>
  <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> We talked a lot about robots. I found that almost everyone in the program agreed on what a robot is or is not. I realized that some things I didn't previously consider as being robots actually were, such as self driving cars. I am excited to see the new ways robots will continue to improve our lives, and I hope they don't do the opposite! </p>
<h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Intro to Robotics- Blinking LED's </h2>
  <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> Me and my partner, Inspire, worked together to create our light show to the song "That's What I Like" by Bruno Mars. I calculated the frequency of the beats and converted it so that it would work in the Tinkercad simulator. Working with a partner really worked well because we had different strengths and used them appropriately. I was really glad to have my partner because she helped to fix my mistakes on my breadboard circuit. I also learned about Arduino. The basic parts of an Arduino sketch are two functions called <b>setup()</b> and <b>loop()</b>
<h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Intro to Robotics- Dance Party </h2>
  <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> I worked with Inspire again to make our robot dance to the same song we made the LED light show with! My favorite part was that we found a way to make a slower turn than the rest of the movements in the dance.I also got to expand my limited knowledge of circuits from my physics class. I learned more about what circuits could accomplish. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Intro to Robotics- Escape Bot </h2>
  <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> I worked with a new group to make a robot that can change direction when it senses an obstacle! See below! </p>

  <h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Django 1 </h2>
     <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> Today we were introduced to MVC, frameworks, and Django. Model-view-controller paradigm (MVC) is a way to relate user interface to underlying data models. A framework is different from a library because a library is a premade collection of functions/methode/etc., while a framework is a collection of what is used in a certain application. I'd prefer a framework over creating my own app to keep my work organized/legible to others and efficient. </p>
    <h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Django Blog </h2>
   <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> I wish that I could've finished the Django Tutorial today. I think I could use the structure that we learned while creating our portfolio page to create other webpages to display other kinds of information. I would like to practice using Django more so I can understand it better because I think it is an important framework to learn. I don't quite understand how what we made today fits the framework that we learned yesterday, but I think I will get it better if I continue working with it. </p>
  <h2 style="font-family:century gothic;color:#656466;"> Data Science </h2>
  <p style="font-family:courier;color:#656466;"> Computers process data more efficiently than humans, and allow us to observe things that would be impossible to do on our own. Today I researched about Ursula Endlicher, a woman who uses data to create performances. I thought it was interesting that before she began such an unconventional career she was a web developer/designer. </p>
