<h1 style="font-family:courier;">MY GIRLS WHO CODE REFLECTIONS</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;"> Intro to Robotics </h2>
<p style="font-family:century gothic;"> We talked a lot about robots. I found that almost everyone in the program agreed on what a robot is or is not. I realized that some things I didn't previously consider as being robots actually were, such as self driving cars. I am excited to see the new ways robots will continue to improve our lives, and I hope they don't do the opposite! </p>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;"> Intro to Robotics- Blinking LED's </h2>
<p> Me and my partner worked together to create our light show to the song "That's What I Like" by Bruno Mars. I calculated the frequency of the beats and converted it so that it would work in the Tinkercad simulator. Working with a partner really worked well because we had different strengths and used them appropriately. I was really glad to have my partner because she helped to fix my mistakes on my breadboard circuit. I also learned about Arduino. The basic parts of an Arduino sketch are two functions called <b>setup()</b> and <b>loop()</b>
  <h2 style="font-family:courier;"> Intro to Robotics- Dance Party </h2>
<p> I worked with the same girl I did the blinking LED's with. We used the same song as last time and made our robot dance to it! My favorite part was that we found a way to make a slower turn than the rest of the movements in the dance.I also got to expand my limited knowledge of circuits from my physics class. I learned more about what circuits could accomplish. </p>
